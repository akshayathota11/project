# UK Railway Delay Management Project

#  Objective
To analyze and forecast train delays using real ticketing data, enabling proactive operational improvements.

# Project Structure
- railway system dataset.csv- Raw data
- railway_cleaned.csv: Cleaned data after preprocessing the data
- dataprocessing.py: Python script for data cleaning
- clustering.py: Python script for clustering
- edaanalysis.py: EDA script for

# EDA 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helped us:
Understand the structure and contents of the dataset
Clean and prepare the data (handle missing values, convert formats)
Discover patterns and trends (e.g. delays by time, station, route)
Identify outliers and anomalies in delays and journeys
Select meaningful features for clustering and model training
Gain early insights to guide machine learning and decision-making

# Model Training Summary
You trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a train journey would be delayed.
Target: Is_Delayed (1 = delayed, 0 = on time)
Preprocessing: Datetime conversion, feature extraction, one-hot encoding
Model Evaluation:
Accuracy: ~97%
ROC AUC Score: ~0.86 (very good)
Classification report and confusion matrix
Feature importance analysis
